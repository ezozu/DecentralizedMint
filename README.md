# DecentralizedMint: Secure and Transparent Digital Asset Creation

DecentralizedMint is a Python-based project designed to facilitate the creation and management of digital assets in a decentralized and transparent manner. This platform provides a robust framework for minting, tracking, and managing tokens on a permissionless blockchain, ensuring verifiable ownership and secure transactions. It prioritizes security, auditability, and ease of integration, making it suitable for various use cases, from creating digital collectibles to managing supply chains.

This project addresses the growing need for trustless digital asset management. Existing solutions often rely on centralized authorities, introducing single points of failure and potential censorship. DecentralizedMint leverages blockchain technology to eliminate these risks, enabling users to create and manage their digital assets without intermediaries. The open-source nature of the project promotes community involvement and continuous improvement, ensuring long-term viability and security. The core principle is empowering users with complete control over their assets, fostering innovation and accessibility in the digital economy.

DecentralizedMint distinguishes itself by focusing on modularity and extensibility. It allows developers to easily integrate new features, customize existing components, and adapt the platform to specific requirements. By providing a well-documented and easily understandable codebase, we aim to lower the barrier to entry for developers who want to experiment with and contribute to the project. This fosters a collaborative environment where innovative solutions can be rapidly developed and deployed, driving adoption of decentralized digital asset management.

## Key Features

*   **Secure Minting:** Implements a cryptographically secure minting process to ensure the authenticity and integrity of newly created tokens. The minting process utilizes elliptic-curve cryptography (ECDSA) for signature verification, preventing unauthorized token creation.
*   **Decentralized Ledger:** Leverages a blockchain-based ledger to record all token transactions and ownership, providing a transparent and immutable record of asset history. This ledger is built on a simplified Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism for development and testing purposes; however, integration with more robust consensus algorithms like Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is planned for future releases.
*   **Customizable Token Metadata:** Allows users to define custom metadata for each token, including attributes such as name, description, image URL, and other relevant information. The metadata is stored on-chain, ensuring its permanence and accessibility. This metadata is encoded using JSON and can be queried using standard blockchain explorers.
*   **Role-Based Access Control:** Implements a flexible role-based access control system, allowing users to define different roles and permissions for managing tokens. This enables fine-grained control over who can mint, transfer, and burn tokens. Roles are managed through smart contracts, providing a decentralized and auditable access control mechanism.
*   **Auditable Transactions:** All token transactions are recorded on the blockchain and can be easily audited to verify their validity. Transaction history is readily available and tamper-proof.
*   **API Integration:** Provides a comprehensive API for interacting with the platform, allowing developers to easily integrate it into their own applications. The API is built using the Flask framework and provides endpoints for minting tokens, transferring tokens, querying token metadata, and retrieving transaction history.
*   **Burn Functionality:** Implements a burn function that allows users to destroy tokens, reducing the total supply and potentially increasing the value of the remaining tokens. The burning process is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and verifiability.

## Technology Stack

*   **Python:** The core programming language used for developing the platform. Python's readability and extensive libraries make it ideal for rapid prototyping and development.
*   **Flask:** A lightweight web framework used to build the API. Flask provides a simple and flexible way to create RESTful APIs.
*   **SQLite:** A lightweight database used for storing token metadata and transaction history. SQLite is easy to set up and use, making it ideal for development and testing. For production environments, consider using a more robust database such as PostgreSQL.
*   **ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm):** Used for securing the minting process. ECDSA provides strong cryptographic guarantees against unauthorized token creation. The python-ecdsa library is used for implementation.
*   **JSON:** Used for encoding and decoding token metadata. JSON is a widely used data format that is easy to parse and understand.
*   **Blockchain (Simulated):** For simplicity and ease of deployment, the project utilizes a simulated blockchain environment. This allows developers to quickly prototype and test the platform without the overhead of deploying a full-fledged blockchain network. Future versions will integrate with existing blockchain platforms such as Ethereum.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    git clone https://github.com/ezozu/DecentralizedMint.git
    cd DecentralizedMint

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  (Linux/macOS)
    .\venv\Scripts\activate  (Windows)

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4.  **Initialize the database:**
    python init_db.py

## Configuration

The platform can be configured using environment variables. The following environment variables are supported:

*   `DATABASE_URL`: The URL of the SQLite database. Defaults to `sqlite:///decentralized_mint.db`.
*   `PORT`: The port on which the API will listen. Defaults to `5000`.
*   `DEBUG`: Whether to run the API in debug mode. Defaults to `False`.
*   `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key used for signing transactions. It must be an ECDSA private key in PEM format. This is crucial for securing the minting process and should be kept secret.
*   `PUBLIC_KEY`: The corresponding public key for the private key above. This is used for verifying transaction signatures.

You can set these environment variables using the `export` command (Linux/macOS) or the `set` command (Windows). For example:

export DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///my_database.db
export PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"
export PUBLIC_KEY="-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\n...\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----"

Alternatively, you can create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and define the environment variables there. The `python-dotenv` library can be used to load the environment variables from the `.env` file.

## Usage

1.  **Run the API:**
    python app.py

2.  **API Documentation:**

    The API provides the following endpoints:

    *   `POST /mint`: Mints a new token. Request body must include token metadata as a JSON object. Requires a valid signature using the `PRIVATE_KEY`.
        Example:
        curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "MyToken", "description": "A digital collectible", "image": "https://example.com/image.png"}' http://localhost:5000/mint
        The request also requires a `signature` header containing the signature of the request body using the `PRIVATE_KEY`.

    *   `GET /token/{token_id}`: Retrieves the metadata for a specific token.
        Example:
        curl http://localhost:5000/token/1

    *   `POST /transfer`: Transfers a token to a new owner. Request body must include the `token_id` and the `new_owner_address`.
        Example:
        curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"token_id": 1, "new_owner_address": "0x1234567890"}' http://localhost:5000/transfer
        The request also requires a `signature` header containing the signature of the request body using the `PRIVATE_KEY`.

    *   `POST /burn`: Burns a token, destroying it permanently. Request body must include the `token_id`.
        Example:
        curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"token_id": 1}' http://localhost:5000/burn
        The request also requires a `signature` header containing the signature of the request body using the `PRIVATE_KEY`.
